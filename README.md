The project begins with cleaning up faulty and untidy data and then moves to data analysis.

The insights below are discovered through data exploration and analysis of the dataset.

 ## üìà **I. General Market Trends (All Area Types)**:

- **Resale Dominates:** Most transactions are "Resale," with higher average prices than new properties.
- **High Demand for Apartments/Houses:**  Most buyers are looking for apartments or houses.
- **Low Price, Ready, Unfurnished:** The market favors lower-priced, ready-to-move-in, unfurnished properties.

 ## üìç **II. Specific Area Analysis**:

 ### üõãÔ∏è ***A. Super Area & Carpet Area (Focus on Residential)***:

**Similarities**:
- **High Listing Volume:** Both have the highest number of property listings, mostly "Resale."
- **Unfurnished Apartments:** Primarily offer unfurnished apartments at relatively low prices.
- **Immediate Occupancy:** Most properties are ready to move in.

**Distinctions**:
-   **Super Area** - Most Listings, Lowest Prices: Has the most listings but the lowest average prices. New properties make up a significant portion of listings.
-   **Carpet Area** - High Demand, Higher Prices: Second highest in listings and prices, indicating strong demand for usable space.

### üèóÔ∏è ***B.  Built Area & Plot Area (Focus on Land/Industrial)***:

**Similarities**:
- **Fewer Listings, Higher Prices:** Fewer listings overall, but higher prices due to the focus on land, plots, villas, and industrial properties.
- **Limited Details:** Furnishing and status are often unspecified.

**Distinctions**:
-   **Built Area** - Industrial Focus, Extremely High Prices: Very few listings, but extremely high prices driven by industrial properties.
-   **Plot Area** - Land/Plot Only: Exclusively lists land or plots, with more listings than "Built Area."

*(Due to the nature of Built Area and Plot Area, which mostly focus on industrial areas, villas, or land/plot correlation, it is not possible for these groups)*
